# Who is this path for and why does it exist?

The way of the green man is a joyful new path for men to grow and to be healed. If you are not a man, then this path is not for you. What is a man? I hear you ask. The answer is simple: the defining characteristic of a man is someone with an overabundance of strength.

If you do not have an overabundance of strength, then you are not a man and this path is not for you. This is not a path for boys, girls, or women because none of these types have an overabundance of strength as their defining characteristic. When someone, for example, who identifies as a woman acts out of an overabundance of strength, then she is simply acting like a man for that moment. A man is not a man forever-and-always. A man is a person who notices they have an overabundance of strength and simply chooses for themselves that they want to move into that role. They are free to change their mind at any time.

A person with an overabundance of strength can have any sort of genitals, can have any loudness and timbre of voice. A person is a man when they have this strength. And— first and foremost— this is a path for a man.

This is the path of the _green_ man, which means that the man has to have cultivated compassion for all things. The Green Man recognizes the damage that men have caused over the centuries and millennia, and he understands that the next stage in the evolution and development of men is quite clear: they must die. Men have been vanquished by the weak. The bully has been overturned, destroyed, and eradicated. The evil oppressor, the billionaire business man, the swindler, the rapist solider: they have all been murdered and buried six feet under.

In our ancient history, the man has used his overabundance of strength to do amazing things: he has built societies, he defeated hunger, and he has created wealth. The Green Man appreciates the work of his ancient brothers. This is part of his compassion. He also appreciates that his ancient brothers wreaked destruction on the world with their overabundance of strength. They chopped forests to clearcuts, they built smokestacks to destroy the atmosphere, they built bombs that could destroy cities, they oppressed women and exploited every form of weakness.

They are now all being killed off. G-d bless them all. The Green Man accepts this ending for their story.

But the Green Man knows too that the archetype of the man is eternal, and it cannot really be killed: it can only be transformed. He knows that there is a pathway through death, and the next phase of man is still one of life and one of strength.

Man will emerged from his grave penetrated by the earth. He will be consumed by the plants, suffused with compassion and generosity and a love for all things. He understands the plight that men have wrought on the world, and yet he still appreciates the need for man and wants to help his own kind to grow up and grow out of their shame.

## Part 1. Starting on the Path

To start on this path, there are but two requirements: one, that you are a man. This is your choice. Decide for yourself if an overabundance of strength is your defining characteristic (or if you want it to be).

The second requirement is that you are green. To be green, you must deemed to have grown enough in your practice of compassion to be accepted into the path. This is not your choice. The way of the green man is not for men who are trying to "seek their fortune." It is not for men who are on a quest, except to find themselves. If this is the kind of man you are, then you belong on a different path, and G-d bless you. Come back to us after you have been killed by the weak and your arrogance has been composted.

If you are that compassionate man, then this path may be offered to you.

The path is quite simple and contains but two instructions: there is one thing that you must strive not do, and there is one thing that you must strive always to do.

## Step 1. What you must strive not do

Here is what you must strive not to do: do not deny yourself or any part of yourself. Or, put in positive terms: strive to acknowledge and to accept all parts of yourself without conflict, defensiveness, or condemnation. You are what you are.

For example, there are a lot of things inside your mind, heart, soul, that you wish were not there. There are embarrassing secrets, horrible thoughts, sinful actions, and simple fuck-ups. These things belong to you. Own them. They are yours to keep.

In addition, you must not deny your needs either. These are also part of yourself. Do not pretend that you do not have them. Do not lie to yourself or others that you have them.

Let's take a crude example by way of illustration. You may have a penis. You may want, for example, to fuck your aunt with that penis. This is, of course, a shameful desire to have, as we have all undoubtedly learned. But if this desire is true for you, then it is true. It's important that you accept it in yourself and do not pretend that it does not exist. Don't lie to yourself or others. Your job is not to deny yourself or who you are.

And, let's face it, in this hypothetical situation, you are probably not going to get to fuck your aunt with your penis. It may not be appropriate to even mention this urge of yours to your aunt. In your compassion for all things, you appreciate that women have been tormented by men pressuring them for sex. You understand that even openly expressing thoughts about your urges can be oppressive.

But perhaps this aunt of yours is a strong woman who would feel safe hearing about your urges. Perhaps you are aware of the fact that she does not have agreements with any sexual partners that would preclude her from having sex with you. Perhaps you have noticed a certain sexual interest or flirtation from her. In this case, you may make it known to your aunt that you would like to fuck her with your penis. You understand consent. You tell your aunt (or anyone else who needs to know) that you want to fuck her. You listen to her response. You accept her choices.

Your aunt may need taking care of if you ask her a question like this. You are strong. You are compassionate. You will listen; you will give her a shoulder to cry on; you will take her slaps of disapproval; you will take her verbal abuse. Anything she wants to offer you, you will take because you have an overabundance of strength and you are on the path of the green man, which is grounded in kindness and compassion.

It's critical at this juncture to balance all three aspects of being a green man to move into the fourth. First, you have compassion and strength, so you are accepting all of the abuse and judgments that may be coming from the reaction of your un-fucked aunt. You are listening to her tell you that you're a monster, and you can see the monstrous parts of yourself and you practice the One Rule of What Not to Do: you do not deny any part of you is monstrous. It's absolutely true that there are monstrous parts. You do not deny them.

## Step 2. What you must strive to do

But this leads us to the fourth aspect of the path of the Green Man. What you must strive to do. When you see something monstrous in yourself or in others, you forgive it. Immediately and without question.

Again, to forgive takes enormous strength. It takes a man to follow this path.

Forgiveness is the one action that a Green Man must take in his heart to all challenges to his character. If he is asked, "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?" By the un-fucked aunt, the answer he has is simply, "No. I have forgiven myself. I can see that you're right, that this part of me is monstrous, and I recognize it and accept it. I apologize for it, and I will refrain in the future from discussing my sexual desires with you. I also understand that I am still beautiful. I forgive this part of myself. Thank you for pointing it out to me, that I may see it."

You do not take on shame because that would be denying a part of yourself. Shame is simple self-condemnation. It's when you believe a part of yourself is unacceptable and not worthy to live. Well, the Green Man will let it die and let it be forgiven, composted, and reborn. This is the path of the Green Man.

## Projection or forgiveness

Men of compassion have been struggling with how to behave and how to act. They are told that they have wrought awful destruction on the world, that they are rapists and oppressors and have unconscious bias to support themselves. This is all true. And these men are intelligent and compassionate enough to listen and to agree with the facts of the world. They have been practicing the first principle of the Green Man: not to deny parts of themselves.

They see that part of them is male and that this part of themselves established the patriarchy and pushed down the weak in every corner of the world.

But unless men of compassion practice the fourth aspect of the way of the Green Man, they are doomed to simply repeat their mistakes in another form. There are really two choices: forgiveness and projection. Without forgiveness, they have only one choice left with how to deal with the monstrous parts of themselves, for guilt and fear is the insidious mind-killer.

Projection is the only choice and in the final analysis, is the same as self-denial: "That's not me!" They would proclaim, "I would never do that to you!"

And that's a lie. The unhealed male part of themselves would certainly do that to you if it could. They deny themselves at their own peril, because they will inevitably find themselves when they are acting out the oppression and treachery of their forefathers: they will be sexually harassing, they will be financially exploiting, they will be killing and gaslighting and lying and cheating.

They have to admit, accept, and honor every aspect of themselves, including all the shit that other men have done in the past, all the horrendous thoughts that are going through their own heads all the time, all the things they think about when they masturbate in the dark. These have to all be accepted and brought to light, for they are part of us all.

Forgive them.

Accept them.

Let them die, in order to be suffused with the power of compassion.

Be strong. Stay compassionate. Accept all aspects of yourself, and forgive all things. This is the way of the Green Man.

## The new weak ones

The weak ones have triumphed, to the glory of the Earth. The coal plants will stop spewing toxins into the skies, and the oceans will be cleaned of their choking plastic. The sex traffickers will be stopped and the pedophiles arrested. The women who were ground under the boot of patriarchy have risen up. They are taking control. They are correcting the mistakes of the past. They are not allowing raw strength to rule them any longer.

And now, they are no longer weak. The arc of history is that raw and brutal strength will eventually be overcome by wisdom, compassion, and tenderness. And so, to that end, the man is the ultimate loser in this cosmic arc.

So, now that the women and children are taking over for the mis-management of men, who are the new weak ones that need protection?

The answer is as simple as it is obvious: the small and vulnerable parts of men.

Yes, it is a time-honored cliché that the man in the huge F-350 pickup truck is compensating for a small penis. How desperately difficult it is for a man to have a small penis!

And yet every man has a "small penis" of one kind or another: perhaps this man's "small penis" is a lack of education. That man's small-penis is a receding hairline. Or perhaps this other man literally has a very small penis. We are all ashamed of our small penises, and our forefathers compensated for their tiny little cocks by using their strength to oppress. They may have had unimpressive genitals, but they were going to use their strength to make sure that thing got sucked anyway.

As men, we have always been ashamed of parts of ourselves, and we use our strength to hide from that shame. We cannot have the girl of our dreams, and so we have raped her. We are not the youngest, bravest, most intelligent man, but we can buy the largest truck or the biggest dog or the largest rifle. We have tried—fruitlessly—to protect our insecurities with our strength.

But the fight is over. We have lost. And thank G-d that we lost. Because if we hadn't lost we'd still be fighting this worthless, pointless battle to compensate for our unworthiness.

Men: whatever it was that you were afraid of is true. Are you worried that nobody would love you because you're too fat? It's true. Are you worried that you are unloveable because you are boring, stupid, or scrawny? Yes, that's true too. But none of those parts are actually you. Let them go. Let them die and be composted. Rise up as your authentic small-penis self.

The Green Man is Salieri: "Mediocrities of the world, I absolve you."

You are mediocre. You are unworthy. You have lost. You are dead. You are being composted. You have been absolved. You are the Green Man.

The thing you were trying to protect was not actually you. You hid it. You did not want everyone to know that you were bald under your toupé or that you secretly felt like an imposter in your own boardroom. But these ones— the weakest of the weak— it is now their turn to be healed. The women and the children had to slay the strong to set you all free. They killed the men and composted them in order for this, the very weakest among us, to finally be given a voice.

The new weak are the inner and vulnerable voices of men. The ones that the men's strength was really meant to protect. It is their time now.

Ironically, in this post-modern age of the triumph of women an children over the strength of men, it is the men who are reborn and who have the most to gain by letting these most vulnerable voices be heard and healed.
